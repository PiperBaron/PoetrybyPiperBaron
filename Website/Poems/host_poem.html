                  <p>Host was written for a Creative Writing course in May of 2019, when I was in my
                     second year of college</p>
                  
                  <p>This poem is, on the surface, about someone discovering something living within them.
                     This parasite takes over their body over the course of the work, and by the end, the
                     parasite and host are one.</p>
                  
                  <p>This is mean to communicate the feeling of mental illness and how it encroaches into
                     your personality and identity. I struggle a lot with my mental health, and I have
                     felt at times that the darker parts of myself, the illness, consumes me whole.</p>
