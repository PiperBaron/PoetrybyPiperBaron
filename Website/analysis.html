                    <p>Hmmm... Not super enlightening. That's what word counts tend to look like,
                        and it's why's they're not very useful in isolation. The most insightful
                        piece of information that we can gather from this is something I mentioned
                        in a <a
                            href="https://piperbaron.github.io/PoetrybyPiperBaron/Posts/post_5.html"
                            >blog post</a> as I was first conducting this kind of analysis: I tend
                        to use the words "I" and "me" a LOT in my works. Makes sense, given that
                        most of my poems are written from my own point of view!</p>
                    <p>But, if we scroll down just a bit, we'll find a few more interesting
                        entries:</p>
                    <img src="Analysis/Images/words2_hl.png" class="image" alt="" />
                    <img src="Analysis/Images/words3_hl.png" class="image" alt="" />
                    <p>That's more like it! We can see some more intriguing words I tend to use a
                        lot in my poems like: heartbeat, eyes, cry, and blood! How fun.</p>
                    <p>To get a better context for these word counts, we can use N-Grams.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="analysis_item">
                    <div id="N-Grams" class="item_title">N-Gram Analysis and Concordance Plots</div>
                    <p>N-Grams are continous sections of text (usually a few words in a sequence)
                        that can be very illuminating in text analysis, as they reveal what
                        phrases/combinations of words are most common in a work.</p>
                    <p>My top 20 N-Grams are:</p>
                    <img src="Analysis/Images/ngrams1.PNG" class="image" alt="" />
                    <p>Unlike with word counts, we can already see some interesting patterns. First
                        there's "like a," my 4th most common N-Gram, obviously an product of the
                        fact that this is poetry, thus heavy on the metaphors and similies.</p>
                    <p>To make this analysis even more illuminating, we can bring in confordence
                        plots, which will show us even more text that surrounds these
                        N-Grams/words.</p>
                    <p>Taking a closer look at the concordence plot for "I" to get a better
                        understand <i>how</i> exactly it gets used most frequently:</p>
                    <img src="Analysis/Images/concordance3.PNG" class="image" alt="" />
                    <p>Instead of focusing on action (I do, I think, I go), my writing tends to skew
                        towards emotion and sensation (I ache, I can feel/sense/see/hear).</p>
                    <p>We can use concordence plots of simimlar N-Grams ("of my" and "of your") to
                        see if there's any contrast between them:</p>
