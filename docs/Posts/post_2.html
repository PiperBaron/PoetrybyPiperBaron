                    <p>The structure of a poem — what lines go into a stanza, how thoughts are
                        broken up into lines, where the line breaks are placed — is almost as
                        important as the words chosen throughout. It dictates the pace of a poem,
                        how fast it's read, and even the meaning; putting emphasis on certain words
                        through enjambing can create a new context in which the words are read.</p>

                    <p>Take the first poem of my project, <a href="https://piperpoetry.newtfire.org/Poems/pulse_poem.html">Pulse</a>, as an example. The structure was
                        very deliberately crafted in order to maintain and build on a rhythm as the
                        poem went forth, that rhythm being representative of a heartbeat, and
                        integral to the meaning and experience of the poem itself.</p>

                    <div class="block">
                        <div>Heartbeat.</div>
                        <div>Shockingly dim and</div>
                        <div>a whimpering in the</div>
                        <div>empty cavern of a</div>
                        <div>cavity left cold and</div>
                        <div>decaying.</div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Each line break is put where it is, because that collection of words had the
                        appropriate amount of syllables to further that cadenced pattern. Without
                        this very specific structure, the piece wouldn't be the same, that rhythmic
                        layer underneath the words written would be lost, and the poem weaker for
                        it. I find that incredible, reflecting on it now, that something so
                        seemingly innocuous as line breaks can shift the message of a work.</p>

                    <p>Things can get messy, however, when a poem with a structure so critical to
                        its foundation is encoded with XML (or rendered into web space using HTML).
                        For my project, my objective was to include a level of interactivity with my
                        poetry by embedding information on certain lines (like the intended meaning
                        of a metaphor) that could be clicked/hovered over by the user. I grouped
                        relevant lines together in my XML using an extra element, and hard-coded in
                        some onclick events into the specific lines/line groupings that I had made
                        annotations for. When looking at both the XML and HTML, the visual structure
                        for the poem had been disrupted — that purposeful and deliberate framework
                        was muddled by the extraneous code, and the soul of my work was getting lost
                        within it.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>I hadn’t particularly desired to create my XML/HTML this way, but being an
                        amateur in JavaScript, I knew no other way at the time to add that
                        functionality without that aforementioned disruption. It’s kind of
                        fascinating, though, that the constraints of my knowledge with JavaScript
                        had an effect on my poetic structure, on the artistry of my work, in such a
                        subtle way. </p>

                    <p>Because, while this way of coding had no consequences on the way the poem is
                        read from the front-end by the viewer, it interferes with the spirit of the
                        work. For a project in which poetry, and thus poetic structure, is central,
                        to preserve that spirit should be a priority.</p>
