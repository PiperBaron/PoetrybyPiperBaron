                    <p>I’ve conducted more analyses on my own poetry. This time, I’m looking at
                        N-grams (sequences of ‘N’ words/text). This is sometimes more helpful to
                        look at than just individual words alone, as they can give a better
                        understanding of the patterns of writing and commonly used phrases in a
                        piece of text.</p>

                    <p>I looked at the whole of my poetry collection so far, as well as two
                        individual poems (Host and Hollow, as they’re reminiscent and might be
                        interesting to compare). My most used N-grams of interest are: “I can,” “can
                        feel,” “the eyes,” “my body,” and “to burst.” Again, lots of focus on
                        feeling, on personal experience and sensation, and those damned eyes!!
                        Analyzing Hollow and Host didn’t give me much, as they’re not very long
                        poems, but I did want to briefly touch on the concordance plots as they
                        contrast (and reflect) one another.</p>

                    <img src="../images/concordance%20host.PNG" class="center" />

                    <p>The concordance for each on the word “I” are honestly strikingly similar.
                        Lots of “I am,” “I can,” “I feel.” </p>

                    <p>But, the way it’s distributed throughout the poems is almost the complete
                        opposite. </p>

                    <p>Host is about a parasite consuming the host whole, yet the “I”s are
                        concentrated towards the end -- a reflection of the parasite and host
                        getting lost within one another. Hollow is a poem focused on the internal
                        thoughts of an anorexic, describing the feeling of hunger, where the
                        frequency of “I” decreases as the work goes on -- the person behind the
                        eating disorder fades and all that’s left is their obsession. I guess it’s
                        just interesting to get a visual on the way these two seemingly analogous
                        poems differ. </p>

                    <p>Beyond just comparing my work to itself, we also thought it’d be enlightening
                        to see how my work relates to the poetry of other artists I admire (and I’m
                        sure take unconscious inspiration from). One of my absolute favorite authors
                        of all time is H. P. Lovecraft, so it seemed like a no-brainer to compare my
                        stuff to some of his most famous poems (yes, he did poetry!)</p>

                    <p>Some note-worthy words that he used most were “strange,” “black,” “ancient,”
                        and “dead.” Definitely fits with what I had expected from him. N-grams
                        included “I knew,” “the vast,” “the night,” and “I saw.” Honestly, seeing
                        that Lovecraft also relied heavily on a first-person perspective and had a
                        N-gram list full of “I”s helped relieve the stress I had of my own work
                        being too same-y and repetitive. Though, interestingly enough, sorting
                        through the concordance with the the word “I” through the Lovecraft
                        analysis, I see that most of his use is through action (I saw, heard, had,
                        found, etc.) where as my usage tends to stray towards emotion (I
                        feel/felt).</p>
