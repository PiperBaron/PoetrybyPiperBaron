                <div id="post_text">
                    <p>As I noted in my previous post, text mining is a goal for this project. In
                        order to do this kind of analysis on a body of works (like a collection of
                        poetry), it’s easiest to combine all of the text from each entry and dump it
                        all into one document that can be analyzed as a whole. One could brute-force
                        this process by manually copy-pasting every piece by hand, but in all
                        honesty, that’s wasted time that could be much better spent working on
                        something else. So, we automate it.</p>

                    <p>That brings us to XQuery, a language designed to help, well, query, and
                        transform large collections of (typically) structured text. Using it, we can
                        write a very simple script that iterates over each document, takes all of
                        its internal text (the whole thing or just specific elements), and spits it
                        out into one big master document -- all in a click of a button. Pretty
                        standard stuff, really.</p>

                    <p>Things get interesting when you do this whole operation while <i>still creating
                        the collection of texts you’re querying</i>, like I am. As it stands right now,
                        my poetry collection is a little half-way to its ideal finished state,
                        meaning I have quite a few more poems to write, but I decided to try getting
                        a head start on the query business early. I’ve been able to analyze my
                        writing so far, and it’s given quite a few insights. Insights that may
                        influence the way I write in the future…</p>

                    <p>I notice that I rely on certain words a lot: “heartbeat”, “eyes”, “feel”,
                        “like”, and “body”. All of my poems, every single one, are in first-person
                        (“I” was used 10 times across 4 poems). The poems have an overall negative
                        vibe to them, though this was a factor that I was aware of even before the
                        analysis.</p>

                    <p>After reviewing the results a few days ago, I’ve found myself contemplating
                        on what it might mean going forward. I have many ideas in my head for new
                        poems, ideas that fall very much in-line with these trends that I now feel
                        hesitant to engage with. There are a surge of questions that flood through
                        me whenever I sit down to write.</p>

                    <p>Do I really want a collection of homogeneous writing that all sounds the
                        same? Shouldn’t I attempt some level of variety, a difference in
                        perspective? Will it cheapen the work by being lacking in diversity of
                        themes and images?</p>

                    <p>And, yet, on the other hand… Wouldn’t it be inauthentic to alter the way I
                        write, directly from the heart, to fit some arbitrary standard? Will it
                        devalue the entire project to write from a place of being put-upon, of
                        insecurity in the writing itself, rather than trusting my own intuition?</p>

                    <p>But how else can I improve my writing -- if I don’t adjust, will I
                        stagnate?</p>

                    <p>It’s exciting as it is overwhelming, because I don’t have the answers to any
                        of these questions. As I sit down in the coming days and weeks, and force
                        out words onto the page, we’ll see if that influence is great enough to
                        justify all of this ruminating.</p>

                    <p>Beyond just the influence on poetry, there is also the query itself to be
                        considered. I structure my poem documents to include the poem itself and a
                        section of line infos that contain annotations of certain lines/stanzas (I
                        think I mentioned them before). I realized upon evaluation that I, without
                        even thinking, resolved to query without these <code>lineInfo</code>
                        elements, only iterating on the <code>poem</code> element itself. But, why?
                        Are they not a part of the document, my own writing? I think of them as
                        “extras,” as a borderline after-thought to the actual text. But, that may be
                        my own bias as ~poet~ shining through. They’re a part of the project after
                        all, why shouldn’t they be represented in the analysis?</p>
                    
                    <p>I have much to think about it seems, and even more querying to do...</p>
