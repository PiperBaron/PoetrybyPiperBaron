                    <div id="date">Oct 28, 2021</div>
                </div>
                <div id="post_text">
                    <p><a href="https://www.decontextualize.com/">Allison Parrish</a> is a poet and
                        a programmer who intermingles these two worlds brilliantly across her many
                        projects. You can find her full portfolio <a
                            href="https://portfolio.decontextualize.com/">here</a>. I wanted to
                        explore her work and reflect on it as some of what I’m doing currently with
                        this project approaches some of her ideas.</p>

                    <p>While looking through her work, I found myself coming back to her <a
                            href="https://reconstructions.decontextualize.com/">Reconstructions
                            site</a>. The project is (to quote her) “an infinite computer-generated
                        poem whose output conforms to the literary figure of chiasmus.” Lines are
                        pulled from poems in the Gutenberg Poetry corpus and randomly selected to be
                        conformed to an ABBA scheme. It continues infinitely until the page is
                        closed.</p>

                    <p>The idea of a poem that is literally never-ending, going on forever if you
                        let it, is so completely fascinating to me. The words are nice, sometimes a
                        particularly poignant combination of lines is created, but obviously the
                        significance of a work like this is its infinity. A wonderful detail of the
                        site is that as new lines are added, older ones are raised to the edges of
                        the screen, made translucent and faded, but they never disappear. They're
                        memory is preserved on the page, always a part of the full poem, even as it
                        grows larger and larger.</p>

                    <p>I'd love to be able to do something like this -- create a poem that's core
                        concept is rooted in its construction rather than just its words. I'm not
                        sure if that's quite possible for this project, but it's something I will
                        always have in the back of my mind.</p>

                    <p>Another work from Parrish that fills this role is her piece <a
                            href="https://sync.abue.io/issues/190705ap_sync2_27_compasses.pdf"
                            >Compasses</a>, a collection of very unique poems that are all made of 4
                        main words, one a each "direction" like a compass, with words generated by
                        an AI that sort of bridge the gap phonetically between the 4 directional
                        terms ("north" -> "earthe" -> "east"). The poems utilize shape as much as
                        they do their terms and AI component, which I found thought really added an
                        extra dimension to the work. It’s fun, a work that doesn’t take itself too
                        seriously, but does influence you to ponder the nature of space within a
                        written work. I want so badly to implement something as clever into my own
                        work, if I can.</p>

                    <p>One more interesting entry in Parrish’s repertoire is her <a
                            href="https://github.com/aparrish/corpus-driven-narrative-generation/blob/master/corpus-driven-narrative-generation.ipynb"
                            >Corpus-driven Narrative Generation notebook</a>. It’s built in Python,
                        meant to pull grammatical and named entity data from a large body of text
                        using natural language processing. From this, one can play around with the
                        data they extract and create some really funky pieces of work. She’s set it
                        up in a way wherein you can write out whole scenes from randomly generated
                        text. Take a look at this bit of the code:</p>

                    <pre>
                        rules = {
    "subject": [w.text for w in subjects],
    "object": [w.text for w in objects],
    "verb": [w.text for w in past_tense_verbs if w.text not in ('was', 'were', 'went')], # exclude common irregular verbs
    "adj": [w.text for w in adjs],
    "people": [w.text for w in people],
    "loc": [w.text for w in locations],
    "time": [w.text for w in times],
    "origin": "#scene#\n\n[charA:#subject#][charB:#subject#][prop:#object#]#sentences#",
    "scene": "SCENE: #loc#, #time.lowercase#",
    "sentences": [
        "#sentence#\n#sentence#",
        "#sentence#\n#sentence#\n#sentence#",
        "#sentence#\n#sentence#\n#sentence#\n#sentence#"
    ],
    "sentence": [
        "#charA.capitalize# #verb# #prop#.",
        "#charB.capitalize# #verb# #prop#.",
        "#prop.capitalize# became #adj#.",
        "#charA.capitalize# and #charB# greeted each other.",
        "'Did you hear about #object.lowercase#?' said #charA#.",
        "'#subject.capitalize# is #adj#,' said #charB#.",
        "#charA.capitalize# and #charB# #verb# #object#.",
        "#charA.capitalize# and #charB# looked at each other.",
        "#sentence#\n#sentence#"
    ]
}

                    </pre>

                    <p>This is setting up an array filled with this random data, and constructing a
                        little set-piece with said data. This is expounded upon further down the
                        notebook, using other modules to weave together more complex thoughts, but
                        the level of control here is what I enjoy the most. There’s an insane amount
                        of potential in this, and given some previously-mentioned, potential
                        limitations in my word choice and subject matter, this could be an amazing
                        tool to mix things up and generate unique ideas! </p>
