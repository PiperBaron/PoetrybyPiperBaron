                    <p>Writing this reflection now, it’s wild to me that my time at Behrend has
                        passed so quickly, that I’m in my last stretch already. I’ve spent years
                        preparing, and yet I can’t help but feel like I’m blinding jumping into the
                        deep end as I embark on my senior project. It’s so exciting even with the
                        anxiety and pressure; I have the freedom to create something wholly of my
                        own design, dedicate months to nurturing a collection of artwork built
                        entirely by myself… I’m grateful that I have the opportunity. </p>
                    <p>One fun aspect of taking on a multi-part, complex project such as this one is
                        the unforeseen obstacles that turn into boons. Take my janky code that I
                        concocted in my first week on the job -- it was haphazardly put together,
                        not very well-organized, just so that I could get a quick working concept
                        going. Out of that foundation, my professor and I have been crafting a piece
                        of JavaScript that will do everything I need much more elegantly, and in the
                        process, I’m learning a lot about a language I previously barely understood.
                    </p>
                    <p>It’s all a process, and one that I’m thrilled to be finally taking on.</p>
