                    <p>While word-counts and N-gram/concordance plots are interesting in their own
                        right, the crown-jewel of text analysis is, in my opinion, networks (NTA).
                        They’re extremely useful in visually representing for an audience the
                        intricate, interwoven nature of a piece of text, demonstrating how two or
                        more aspects of a text (characters, settings, themes, word choice, etc.) are
                        related to one another. They can be stunningly beautiful, while also
                        providing a great resource for better understanding a work!</p>

                    <p>When constructing the <a href="../../Website/analysis.html">network</a> for
                        my poetry, I came across multiple, interesting insights into my body of work
                        that I had not previously even considered, similar to my other escapades
                        into analysis. </p>

                    <p>I had no idea that my poems were so interconnected in the way that they are,
                        that you can draw a path from one poem to another through shared themes so
                        easily. Take, for example, the two poems <a
                            href="../../Website/Poems/virga_poem.html">Virga</a> and <a
                            href="../../Website/Poems/clockface_poem.html">Clockface</a>. I wouldn’t
                        expect any relationship between these poems on the surface, but with the
                        network, you can reveal that they share not one but two topics: Fear and
                        Imagery. Something true of both, yet they are so different in their core… </p>

                    <p>We can go even further. If we start with Witness, we can get to <a
                            href="../../Website/Poems/virga_poem.html">Virga</a> via Fear (as said
                        above), then we can get to <a href="../../Website/Poems/host_poem.html"
                            >Host</a> via the topic of Paranoia, which lets us get to <a
                            href="../../Website/Poems/hollow_poem.html">Hollow</a> via the Illness
                        tag, then to <a href="../../Website/Poems/lorn_poem.html">Lorn</a> through
                        Depression… You get it.</p>

                    <p>It’s this amazing spider web of connections and parallels, the joys of
                        analysis!</p>
