                    <p>Something that my professor and I have been pondering of late is the
                        proverbial “home” and nature of the work within this project; In what format
                        or medium, exactly, does the poetry “live?” Where is it most true to my
                        intentions for it, where is it most honest?</p>

                    <p>I’m not sure I really have an answer, but to begin to delve deeper into the
                        topic, we can start where I do: conception. Every poem in this project began
                        as an idea stashed away in a note on my phone, always available to me
                        whenever inspiration strikes. As I think on it more, I begin building the
                        bones of my poem in my head, sounding out the initial word choices and
                        tempo/rhythm. After this, I sit down to “officially” write my poem in a
                        notebook I keep on my desk, safe at home, each line and stanza carefully
                        handwritten.</p>

                    <p>And so, we have our first possible answer to the question: in the notebook of
                        course! It’s where the poem is originally developed, its birthplace. But,
                        this answer would be inadequate, even if it is rather sentimental, as the
                        entries in my notebook do not contain any of the line information, topics,
                        keywords, nor the ever-important accompanying artwork. So, where else could
                        it be?</p>

                    <p>Well, after handwriting them, I transcribe each poem into a large,
                        compilation Google Doc, which is where I begin to input the additional
                        information I listed above. But this form is also missing the artwork, as
                        well as embedded metadata that would give additional context and meaning
                        like the XML encoding would. </p>

                    <p>So it must live in the XML, then, correct? Even there, the art is missing.
                        Without intended audio-visual experience, each poem is, in essence,
                        incomplete. Only with the combination of audio, animated background, and
                        encoded poem, does everything come together the way that I intend. With that
                        conclusion, the best answer I can provide to our questions would be on the
                        website itself, trapped within HTML. But even this response feels lacking
                        and disingenuous. </p>

                    <p>Open any poem on the main site, right click, go into the source code, and
                        just look around. Observe how each line, each stanza, is interrupted by
                        elements wrapping and attributes littering the page. Can you imagine reading
                        any poem this way? Additionally, even with all that I’ve done, I can’t
                        control each person’s viewing and reading experience the way that I truly
                        want to; every monitor has its own color settings, every new mobile devices
                        skews the formatting, those who are hard of hearing or visually impaired
                        will lack the means to fully appreciate what I intend…</p>

                    <p>In the end, I would suppose, even if it’s hideously cliché, that my poetry
                        only really, honestly lives inside of my own mind, and all of my attempts to
                        project it outward are (if only slightly) inaccurate or flawed. Such is the
                        nature of producing art.</p>
