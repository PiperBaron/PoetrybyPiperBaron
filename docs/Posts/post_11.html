                    <p>After 4 months, after countless hours of pouring over poetry, scribbling in
                        Photoshop at the dead of night, reflecting on reflecting, my project is
                        complete.</p>

                    <p>I feel immensely proud to have been given the opportunity to demonstrate my
                        skill and hone my craft these 4 (well, 4 and a half) years, and I believe
                        that this project is the culmination of all that I have learned. </p>

                    <p>Looking back over everything I’ve done over the semester, the poetry and
                        accompanying artwork, I can see that I’ve used this project as a vehicle for
                        my own emotional expression, venting the negativity within me to create a
                        dark and brooding atmosphere on each page. For some time I was quiet…
                        embarrassed by this trajectory I had put myself upon; it felt show-y and
                        over sentimental, but I’m very glad that I allowed myself to express
                        unhindered. </p>

                    <p>This project is a potent of myself, a twisted sort of self-portrait into my
                        most vulnerable of emotions, and is thus very honest and sincere. It truly,
                        in its entirety, is a collection of code, writing, and artwork that
                        represents me, and it’s the first time I’ve done that. Fitting, to have
                        capped off my time at Behrend with such an all-encompassing piece. It’s
                        cathartic.</p>

                    <p>For all those who have visited this site, read through my ramblings, followed
                        each step in creating this beast, I thank you. I hope you enjoyed watching
                        it unfold as much as I did making it. I’ll never forget the process, and I
                        may be crazy enough to do it again in the future… </p>
