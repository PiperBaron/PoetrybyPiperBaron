                    <h5>Dec 15, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">After 4 months, after countless hours of pouring over
                        poetry, scribbling in Photoshop at the dead of night, reflecting on
                        reflecting, my project is complete. I feel immensely proud to have been
                        given the opportunity to demonstrate my skill and hone my craft these 4
                        (well, 4 and a half) years, and I believe that this project is the
                        culmination of all that I have learned. Looking back over everything I’ve
                        done over the semester, the poetry and accompanying artwork, I can see that
                        I’ve used this project as a vehicle for my own emotional expression, venting
                        the negativity within me to create a dark and brooding atmosphere on each
                        page. For some time I was quiet… embarrassed by this trajectory I had put
                        myself upon; it felt show-y and over sentimental, but I’m very glad that I
                        allowed myself to express unhindered.</p>

                    <p class="post_content">While word-counts and N-gram/concordance plots are
                        interesting in their own right, the crown-jewel of text analysis is, in my
                        opinion, networks (NTA). They’re extremely useful in visually representing
                        for an audience the intricate, interwoven nature of a piece of text,
                        demonstrating how two or more aspects of a text (characters, settings,
                        themes, word choice, etc.) are related to one another. They can be
                        stunningly beautiful, while also providing a great resource for better
                        understanding a work! When constructing the network for my poetry, I came
                        across multiple, interesting insights into my body of work that I had not
                        previously even considered, similar to my other escapades into analysis. I
                        had no idea that my poems were so interconnected in the way that they are,
                        that you can draw a path from one poem to another through shared themes so
                        easily. Take, for example, the two poems Virga and Clockface. I wouldn’t
                        expect any relationship between these poems on the surface, but with the
                        network, you can reveal that they share not one but two topics: Fear and
                        Imagery. Something true of both, yet they are so different in their core… </p>

                    <p class="post_content">Something that my professor and I have been pondering of
                        late is the proverbial “home” and nature of the work within this project; In
                        what format or medium, exactly, does the poetry “live?” Where is it most
                        true to my intentions for it, where is it most honest? I’m not sure I really
                        have an answer, but to begin to delve deeper into the topic, we can start
                        where I do: conception. Every poem in this project began as an idea stashed
                        away in a note on my phone, always available to me whenever inspiration
                        strikes. As I think on it more, I begin building the bones of my poem in my
                        head, sounding out the initial word choices and tempo/rhythm. After this, I
                        sit down to “officially” write my poem in a notebook I keep on my desk, safe
                        at home, each line and stanza carefully handwritten. </p>

                    <h5>Nov 12, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">My advising professor recommended to me a few works to
                        reflect on as my project nears its end. <a
                            href="http://www.blakearchive.org/work/songsie">William Blake's <i>Songs
                                of Innocence and Experience</i></a>, for some of its similarity to
                        my own work, and <a
                            href="https://newtfire.org/courses/introDH/LEAF-BY-NIGGLE.html">J. R. R.
                            Tolkien's <i>Leaf by Niggle</i></a>, for its commentary on the artistic
                        process. William Blake's <i>Songs of Innocence and Experience</i> is all
                        about duality, that much is obvious. More specifically, I feel as though
                        this collection is contrasting the variance in humanity, life, and virtue.
                        There is a surprising amount of variety in topic across all of the poems,
                        but they're connected with this through line of contrast. I think the pair,
                            <i>Infant Joy</i> (<i>Songs of Innocence</i>) and <i>Infant Sorrow
                            </i>(<i>Songs of Experience</i>) are perfect examples. They're short
                        poems that both tell the story of a child's birth. You have the <i>Joy</i>
                        poem centered around the bliss of creating new life, from the
                        dual-perspectives of child and mother, joined in their happiness. Then
                            <i>Sorrow</i>, where only the child's view is expressed, and the tone of
                        the poem is sullen. The baby unwanted by its parents, by the end it has
                        nothing left to do other than sulk.</p>

                    <h5>Nov 3, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">I’ve conducted more analyses on my own poetry. This
                        time, I’m looking at N-grams (sequences of ‘N’ words/text). This is
                        sometimes more helpful to look at than just individual words alone, as they
                        can give a better understanding of the patterns of writing and commonly used
                        phrases in a piece of text. I looked at the whole of my poetry collection so
                        far, as well as two individual poems (Host and Hollow, as they’re
                        reminiscent and might be interesting to compare). My most used N-grams of
                        interest are: “I can,” “can feel,” “the eyes,” “my body,” and “to burst.”
                        Again, lots of focus on feeling, on personal experience and sensation, and
                        those damned eyes!! Analyzing Hollow and Host didn’t give me much, as
                        they’re not very long poems, but I did want to briefly touch on the
                        concordance plots as they contrast (and reflect) one another.</p>

                        <h3>The Work of Allison Parrish</h3>
                    </a>
                    <h5>Oct 28, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">Allison Parrish is a poet and a programmer who
                        intermingles these two worlds brilliantly across her many projects. You can
                        find her full portfolio here. I wanted to explore her work and reflect on it
                        as some of what I’m doing currently with this project approaches some of her
                        ideas. While looking through her work, I found myself coming back to her
                        Reconstructions site. The project is (to quote her) “an infinite
                        computer-generated poem whose output conforms to the literary figure of
                        chiasmus.” Lines are pulled from poems in the Gutenberg Poetry corpus and
                        randomly selected to be conformed to an ABBA scheme. It continues infinitely
                        until the page is closed. The idea of a poem that is literally never-ending,
                        going on forever if you let it, is so completely fascinating to me. The
                        words are nice, sometimes a particularly poignant combination of lines is
                        created, but obviously the significance of a work like this is its infinity.
                        A wonderful detail of the site is that as new lines are added, older ones
                        are raised to the edges of the screen, made translucent and faded, but they
                        never disappear. They're memory is preserved on the page, always a part of
                        the full poem, even as it grows larger and larger. </p>

                    <h5>Oct 13, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">As I noted in my previous post, text mining is a goal
                        for this project. In order to do this kind of analysis on a body of works
                        (like a collection of poetry), it’s easiest to combine all of the text from
                        each entry and dump it all into one document that can be analyzed as a
                        whole. One could brute-force this process by manually copy-pasting every
                        piece by hand, but in all honesty, that’s wasted time that could be much
                        better spent working on something else. So, we automate it. That brings us
                        to XQuery, a language designed to help, well, query, and transform large
                        collections of (typically) structured text. Using it, we can write a very
                        simple script that iterates over each document, takes all of its internal
                        text (the whole thing or just specific elements), and spits it out into one
                        big master document -- all in a click of a button. Pretty standard stuff,
                        really.</p>

                    <p class="post_content">For this project, I want to, after all of the poems are
                        finished, conduct some text mining and analysis on them to see if any
                        insights on my own writing can shine through. Text mining is a process done
                        on unstructured text automatically by artificial intelligence using natural
                        language processing (or NLP). It’s very useful in discovering patterns in a
                        piece of text to help better understand it. Forms of text mining can be word
                        frequency (how often certain words are used), collocation (finding sequences
                        of words that often are written near/next to each other), and concordance
                        (finding the context in which certain words are used). Advanced text mining
                        techniques like sentiment analysis (analyzing the associated emotions/moods
                        with words) or intent detection are also common.</p>

                    <p class="post_content">A continuation of my reflection on how poetic structure
                        and HTML converge. I wrote a free-form poem a few years ago by the name of
                        Host. I wanted to include it in my project, because I’m proud of it, and I
                        thought it’d be a good fit. But, upon encoding it into both XML and HTML, I
                        came across some challenges. This poem is free-form/free-verse, e.g. it
                        adheres to no set structure or rhyme scheme. Most of my poems are like this,
                        but Host is particularly egregious, because it was originally written with
                        full-sentence lines and stanzas that were whole paragraphs. I transferred
                        the work as it was, untouched, into the standard HTML/CSS set-up I’d crafted
                        for my poetry and was disheartened to find that it had completely broken the
                        styling. The lines were taking up the whole page, overlapping with the info
                        box at the side, and made a mess of my aesthetic design.</p>

                        almost as important as the words chosen throughout. It dictates the pace of
                        a poem, how fast it's read, and even the meaning; putting emphasis on
                        certain words through enjambing can create a new context in which the words
                        are read. Take the first poem of my project, Pulse, as an example. The
                        structure was very deliberately crafted in order to maintain and build on a
                        rhythm as the poem went forth, that rhythm being representative of a
                        heartbeat, and integral to the meaning and experience of the poem itself. </p>

                    <p class="post_content">Writing this reflection now, it’s wild to me that my
                        time at Behrend has passed so quickly, that I’m in my last stretch already.
                        I’ve spent years preparing, and yet I can’t help but feel like I’m blinding
                        jumping into the deep end as I embark on my senior project. It’s so exciting
                        even with the anxiety and pressure; I have the freedom to create something
                        wholly of my own design, dedicate months to nurturing a collection of
                        artwork built entirely by myself… I’m grateful that I have the opportunity.
                        One fun aspect of taking on a multi-part, complex project such as this one
                        is the unforeseen obstacles that turn into boons. Take my janky code that I
                        concocted in my first week on the job -- it was haphazardly put together,
                        not very well-organized, just so that I could get a quick working concept
                        going. Out of that foundation, my professor and I have been crafting a piece
                        of JavaScript that will do everything I need much more elegantly, and in the
                        process, I’m learning a lot about a language I previously barely understood. </p>
