                    <p>My advising professor recommended to me a few works to reflect on as my
                        project nears its end. <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/work/songsie"
                            >William Blake's <i>Songs of Innocence and Experience</i></a>, for some
                        of its similarity to my own work, and <a
                            href="https://newtfire.org/courses/introDH/LEAF-BY-NIGGLE.html">J. R. R.
                            Tolkien's <i>Leaf by Niggle</i></a>, for its commentary on the artistic
                        process.</p>
                    
                    <p>William Blake's <i>Songs of Innocence and Experience</i> is all about
                        duality, that much is obvious. More specifically, I feel as though this
                        collection is contrasting the variance in humanity, life, and virtue. There
                        is a surprising amount of variety in topic across all of the poems, but
                        they're connected with this through line of contrast.</p>
                    
                    <p>I think the pair, <i>Infant Joy</i> (<i>Songs of Innocence</i>) and <i>Infant
                        Sorrow </i>(<i>Songs of Experience</i>) are perfect examples. They're
                        short poems that both tell the story of a child's birth. You have the
                        <i>Joy</i> poem centered around the bliss of creating new life, from the
                        dual-perspectives of child and mother, joined in their happiness. Then
                        <i>Sorrow</i>, where only the child's view is expressed, and the tone of
                        the poem is sullen. The baby unwanted by its parents, by the end it has
                        nothing left to do other than sulk.</p>
                    
                    <p>Each poem has only 2 stanzas, but are structured slightly differently:
                        <i>Infant Joy</i> uses a AABB rhyme scheme, while Infant Sorrow uses
                        ABCDAC for its first stanza and ABCDDC for its second. This serves to make
                        the <i>Joy</i> poem feel more harmonious and peaceful when read, it has a
                        sense of internal unity. The mismatching and chaotic rhythm of the
                        <i>Sorrow</i> poem gives a more discordant feeling, a sense of
                        "not-quite-right" within the writing itself. </p>
                    
                    <p>One more pair I thought was interesting was both versions of <i>Nurse's
                        Song</i> -- two pieces with the same title but contrasting content.
                        <i>Nurse's Song</i> (<i>Innocence</i>) portrays a carer looking over a
                        group of children playing on the hills. She observes them, speaks to them
                        gently, then takes them in for the night once it gets dark. Again, there's a
                        sense of harmony and peace within the work, an intertwining joy between
                        young and old, with an added theme of nature. <i>Nurse's Song</i>
                        (<i>Experience</i>), on the other hand, the nurse is seen listening in
                        on the children playing, reflecting on her own past and looking towards them
                        with jealousy. She brings the children in early, as she believes that their
                        days are "wasted in play." The fun cut short, there is the echo of the
                        discordance we saw earlier. The nurse is sick, not of the body but of the
                        mind, as she turns "green and pale" at the thought of the children having
                        what she no longer does, youth. </p>
                    
                    <p>Two perspectives, two experiences, two contrasting ways of life that reflect
                        on to each other to create a bigger, fuller picture of humanity. Beautiful
                        and ugly, harmony and discord.</p>
                    
                    <p><i>Leaf by Niggle</i> is, in my opinion, a meta-commentary on the process of
                        creating art in a world that devalues creativity and recreation. Niggle
                        spends so much time pouring love and effort into his work, his ever-growing
                        and infinitely complex Tree, only for the people of his world, his
                        neighbors, the townspeople, the "Voices," to treat his painting as a waste
                        of time. It's better used for material to repair a house. It's all lines and
                        color, nothing of value.</p>
                    
                    <p>Meanwhile, we get the perspectives of what I assume are authority figures in
                        the town: Tompkins. Atkins, and Perkins, who look back on Niggle's life and
                        contemplate his "usefulness." Perkins mentions that he found a torn corner
                        of Niggle's painting left in a field, and had not been able to get it out of
                        its mind, despite how small of a portion it was. That corner, a leaf, hung
                        in the town museum, only to be forgotten. This speaks to the fact that, when
                        given a chance, his work can have a profound effect, but the society
                        surrounding him chooses to neglect his work and let it die with him.</p>
                    
                    <p>His journey, what he pushed off for so long in favor of his painting, is
                        (again, in my opinion) an allegory for death. He is judged, he atones, and
                        he spends his days bettering himself and wandering in a utopic landscape of
                        his own creation. Only in afterlife does his work receive the work it truly
                        deserves and the appreciation it was owed in life. It's left to be enjoyed
                        and loved by Parish and his wife while Niggle goes on to presumably create
                        more scrawling works on beauty. A bittersweet commentary on the artist and
                        their plight.</p>
                    
                    <p>I related very much to the character of Niggle, an almost frightening amount
                        to be honest. I, too, procrastinate on the most important tasks and worry
                        endlessly about perfecting my work. I’ve been told (many times) that I’m
                        complacent, conflict-avoidant, a “yes-man,” very true, I admit, and I can
                        see myself being shuffled around without protest much like Niggle as he’s
                        dragged through his “journey.” I suppose I have an afterlife of finished
                        projects to look forward to.</p>
