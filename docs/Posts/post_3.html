                    <p>A continuation of my reflection on how poetic structure and HTML
                        converge.</p>

                    <p>I wrote a free-form poem a few years ago by the name of <a href="https://piperpoetry.newtfire.org/Poems/host_poem.html">Host</a>. I wanted to
                        include it in my project, because I’m proud of it, and I thought it’d be a
                        good fit. But, upon encoding it into both XML and HTML, I came across some
                        challenges.</p>

                    <p>This poem is free-form/free-verse, e.g. it adheres to no set structure or
                        rhyme scheme. Most of my poems are like this, but Host is particularly
                        egregious, because it was originally written with full-sentence lines and
                        stanzas that were whole paragraphs. I transferred the work as it was,
                        untouched, into the standard HTML/CSS set-up I’d crafted for my poetry and
                        was disheartened to find that it had completely broken the styling. The
                        lines were taking up the whole page, overlapping with the info box at the
                        side, and made a mess of my aesthetic design.</p>

                    <p>In an interesting reverse of my previous conundrum, this obstacle caused me
                        not to re-evaluate the XML, HTML, or CSS, but instead the structure of the
                        poem itself. I realized, staring at the clutter of text, that this wasn’t
                        the best way to arrange the lines, to deliver the thoughts and core of the
                        text. For the pace and rhythm I had in mind, my initial structure wasn’t
                        nearly effective enough. I went back to my Google Docs page and enjambed the
                        poem in a few different ways before settling on the construction that I have
                        now. I think it’s more fitting for the tempo of how I want my audience to
                        read it, it builds tension better, and it overall makes the poem more
                        pleasing to look at, with or without my CSS additions.</p>

                    <p>HTML/CSS structure and styling influenced the way that I looked at and
                        reworked my poem. It gave me a new perspective in how the piece would read
                        to a third-party, and led me to a realization that ultimately ended up in a
                        better formed poem. The relationship between text-encoding and poetry became
                        a two-way street at that moment. They influenced each other equally in this
                        project so far -- the poetry is in no way beholden to conform to an
                        arbitrary XML/HTML structure, but the HTML/CSS is not dictated completely by
                        a given poem, either. They can intermingle, weaving into something that has
                        become a mixture of both, something that embraces the pragmatism of the code
                        and beauty of the artwork.</p>

                    <p>Isn’t that amazing?</p>
                    <!-- 2021-09-21 ebb: So, you should definitely create some code blocks and/or images to show how much this poem changed! Here is how you 
                    make a code block: The <pre> element in HTML contains "preformatted material" which means it preserves spacing and line breaks. 
                    If you want to show the angle-bracket code, you need to escape the angle brackets using the escape characters like this:

                    -->
                    <pre>
                   &lt;div id="s2" class="stanza"&gt;

                  &lt;div id="l2" class="line"&gt;
                     &lt;span class="inner"&gt;It has tendrils threaded like muscle that have wrapped
                        around the beating of my heart, &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;div id="l3" class="line"&gt;
                     &lt;span class="inner"&gt;taking hostage the pumping of my blood in demand of
                        something unknown to me.&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
               &lt;/div&gt;</pre>
                    <p>Tester text. Above the poem in its current state.</p>
