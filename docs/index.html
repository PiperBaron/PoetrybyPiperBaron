                        <h3>On Poetic Structure and HTML</h3>
                    </a>
                    <h5>Sep 14, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">The structure of a poem — what lines go into a stanza, how thoughts are
                        broken up into lines, where the line breaks are placed — is almost as
                        important as the words chosen throughout. It dictates the pace of a poem,
                        how fast it's read, and even the meaning; putting emphasis on certain words
                        through enjambing can create a new context in which the words are read.
                        Take the first poem of my project, Pulse, as an example. The structure was
                        very deliberately crafted in order to maintain and build on a rhythm as the
                        poem went forth, that rhythm being representative of a heartbeat, and
                        integral to the meaning and experience of the poem itself.</p>

                    <p class="post_content">Writing this reflection now, it’s wild to me that my
                        time at Behrend has passed so quickly, that I’m in my last stretch already.
                        I’ve spent years preparing, and yet I can’t help but feel like I’m blinding
                        jumping into the deep end as I embark on my senior project. It’s so exciting
                        even with the anxiety and pressure; I have the freedom to create something
                        wholly of my own design, dedicate months to nurturing a collection of
                        artwork built entirely by myself… I’m grateful that I have the opportunity.
                        One fun aspect of taking on a multi-part, complex project such as this one
                        is the unforeseen obstacles that turn into boons. Take my janky code that I
                        concocted in my first week on the job -- it was haphazardly put together,
                        not very well-organized, just so that I could get a quick working concept
                        going. Out of that foundation, my professor and I have been crafting a piece
                        of JavaScript that will do everything I need much more elegantly, and in the
                        process, I’m learning a lot about a language I previously barely understood.
                        It’s all a process, and one that I’m thrilled to be finally taking on. </p>
