                    <p class="post_content">Writing this reflection now, it’s wild to me that my
                        time at Behrend has passed so quickly, that I’m in my last stretch already.
                        I’ve spent years preparing, and yet I can’t help but feel like I’m blinding
                        jumping into the deep end as I embark on my senior project. It’s so exciting
                        even with the anxiety and pressure; I have the freedom to create something
                        wholly of my own design, dedicate months to nurturing a collection of
                        artwork built entirely by myself… I’m grateful that I have the opportunity.
                        One fun aspect of taking on a multi-part, complex project such as this one
                        is the unforeseen obstacles that turn into boons. Take my janky code that I
                        concocted in my first week on the job -- it was haphazardly put together,
                        not very well-organized, just so that I could get a quick working concept
                        going. Out of that foundation, my professor and I have been crafting a piece
                        of JavaScript that will do everything I need much more elegantly, and in the
                        process, I’m learning a lot about a language I previously barely understood.
                        It’s all a process, and one that I’m thrilled to be finally taking on. </p>

                    <p>My name is Piper Baron! I'm a DIGIT student at Penn State Behrend, currently
                        in my last semester. This blog is meant to be a place for my reflections as
                        I complete my senior project, the link to which can be found below.</p>
