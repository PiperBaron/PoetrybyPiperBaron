                    <p class="post_content">As I noted in my previous post, text mining is a goal
                        for this project. In order to do this kind of analysis on a body of works
                        (like a collection of poetry), it’s easiest to combine all of the text from
                        each entry and dump it all into one document that can be analyzed as a
                        whole. One could brute-force this process by manually copy-pasting every
                        piece by hand, but in all honesty, that’s wasted time that could be much
                        better spent working on something else. So, we automate it. That brings us
                        to XQuery, a language designed to help, well, query, and transform large
                        collections of (typically) structured text. Using it, we can write a very
                        simple script that iterates over each document, takes all of its internal
                        text (the whole thing or just specific elements), and spits it out into one
                        big master document -- all in a click of a button. Pretty standard stuff,
                        really.</p>

                    <h5>Sep 27, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">For this project, I want to, after all of the poems are
                        finished, conduct some text mining and analysis on them to see if any
                        insights on my own writing can shine through. Text mining is a process done
                        on unstructured text automatically by artificial intelligence using natural
                        language processing (or NLP). It’s very useful in discovering patterns in a
                        piece of text to help better understand it. Forms of text mining can be word
                        frequency (how often certain words are used), collocation (finding sequences
                        of words that often are written near/next to each other), and concordance
                        (finding the context in which certain words are used). Advanced text mining
                        techniques like sentiment analysis (analyzing the associated emotions/moods
                        with words) or intent detection are also common. </p>

                        <h3>Free-Form Poetry vs CSS</h3>

                    <h5>Sep 20, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">A continuation of my reflection on how poetic structure
                        and HTML converge. I wrote a free-form poem a few years ago by the name of
                        Host. I wanted to include it in my project, because I’m proud of it, and I
                        thought it’d be a good fit. But, upon encoding it into both XML and HTML, I
                        came across some challenges. This poem is free-form/free-verse, e.g. it
                        adheres to no set structure or rhyme scheme. Most of my poems are like this,
                        but Host is particularly egregious, because it was originally written with
                        full-sentence lines and stanzas that were whole paragraphs. I transferred
                        the work as it was, untouched, into the standard HTML/CSS set-up I’d crafted
                        for my poetry and was disheartened to find that it had completely broken the
                        styling. The lines were taking up the whole page, overlapping with the info
                        box at the side, and made a mess of my aesthetic design.</p>

                    <h5>Sep 14, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">The structure of a poem — what lines go into a stanza,
                        how thoughts are broken up into lines, where the line breaks are placed — is
                        almost as important as the words chosen throughout. It dictates the pace of
                        a poem, how fast it's read, and even the meaning; putting emphasis on
                        certain words through enjambing can create a new context in which the words
                        are read. Take the first poem of my project, Pulse, as an example. The
                        structure was very deliberately crafted in order to maintain and build on a
                        rhythm as the poem went forth, that rhythm being representative of a
                        heartbeat, and integral to the meaning and experience of the poem
                        itself.</p>
