                        <h3>Reflections on Other Works</h3>
                    </a>
                    <h5>Nov 12, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">My advising professor recommended to me a few works to
                        reflect on as my project nears its end. <a
                            href="http://www.blakearchive.org/work/songsie">William Blake's <i>Songs
                                of Innocence and Experience</i></a>, for some of its similarity to
                        my own work, and <a
                            href="https://newtfire.org/courses/introDH/LEAF-BY-NIGGLE.html">J. R. R.
                            Tolkien's <i>Leaf by Niggle</i></a>, for its commentary on the artistic
                        process. William Blake's <i>Songs of Innocence and Experience</i> is all
                        about duality, that much is obvious. More specifically, I feel as though
                        this collection is contrasting the variance in humanity, life, and virtue.
                        There is a surprising amount of variety in topic across all of the poems,
                        but they're connected with this through line of contrast. I think the pair,
                            <i>Infant Joy</i> (<i>Songs of Innocence</i>) and <i>Infant Sorrow
                            </i>(<i>Songs of Experience</i>) are perfect examples. They're short
                        poems that both tell the story of a child's birth. You have the <i>Joy</i>
                        poem centered around the bliss of creating new life, from the
                        dual-perspectives of child and mother, joined in their happiness. Then
                            <i>Sorrow</i>, where only the child's view is expressed, and the tone of
                        the poem is sullen. The baby unwanted by its parents, by the end it has
                        nothing left to do other than sulk.</p>

                        <h3>More Revelations in Analysis</h3>
                    </a>
                    <h5>Nov 3, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">I’ve conducted more analyses on my own poetry. This
                        time, I’m looking at N-grams (sequences of ‘N’ words/text). This is
                        sometimes more helpful to look at than just individual words alone, as they
                        can give a better understanding of the patterns of writing and commonly used
                        phrases in a piece of text. I looked at the whole of my poetry collection so
                        far, as well as two individual poems (Host and Hollow, as they’re
                        reminiscent and might be interesting to compare). My most used N-grams of
                        interest are: “I can,” “can feel,” “the eyes,” “my body,” and “to burst.”
                        Again, lots of focus on feeling, on personal experience and sensation, and
                        those damned eyes!! Analyzing Hollow and Host didn’t give me much, as
                        they’re not very long poems, but I did want to briefly touch on the
                        concordance plots as they contrast (and reflect) one another.</p>

                        <h3>The Work of Allison Parrish</h3>
                    </a>
                    <h5>Oct 28, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">Allison Parrish is a poet and a programmer who
                        intermingles these two worlds brilliantly across her many projects. You can
                        find her full portfolio here. I wanted to explore her work and reflect on it
                        as some of what I’m doing currently with this project approaches some of her
                        ideas. While looking through her work, I found myself coming back to her
                        Reconstructions site. The project is (to quote her) “an infinite
                        computer-generated poem whose output conforms to the literary figure of
                        chiasmus.” Lines are pulled from poems in the Gutenberg Poetry corpus and
                        randomly selected to be conformed to an ABBA scheme. It continues infinitely
                        until the page is closed. The idea of a poem that is literally never-ending,
                        going on forever if you let it, is so completely fascinating to me. The
                        words are nice, sometimes a particularly poignant combination of lines is
                        created, but obviously the significance of a work like this is its infinity.
                        A wonderful detail of the site is that as new lines are added, older ones
                        are raised to the edges of the screen, made translucent and faded, but they
                        never disappear. They're memory is preserved on the page, always a part of
                        the full poem, even as it grows larger and larger. </p>

                        <h3>To Query Poetry (While Writing It)</h3>
                    </a>
                    <h5>Oct 13, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">As I noted in my previous post, text mining is a goal
                        for this project. In order to do this kind of analysis on a body of works
                        (like a collection of poetry), it’s easiest to combine all of the text from
                        each entry and dump it all into one document that can be analyzed as a
                        whole. One could brute-force this process by manually copy-pasting every
                        piece by hand, but in all honesty, that’s wasted time that could be much
                        better spent working on something else. So, we automate it. That brings us
                        to XQuery, a language designed to help, well, query, and transform large
                        collections of (typically) structured text. Using it, we can write a very
                        simple script that iterates over each document, takes all of its internal
                        text (the whole thing or just specific elements), and spits it out into one
                        big master document -- all in a click of a button. Pretty standard stuff,
                        really.</p>
