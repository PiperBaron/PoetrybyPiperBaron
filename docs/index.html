                    <p class="post_content">After 4 months, after countless hours of pouring over
                        poetry, scribbling in Photoshop at the dead of night, reflecting on
                        reflecting, my project is complete. I feel immensely proud to have been
                        given the opportunity to demonstrate my skill and hone my craft these 4
                        (well, 4 and a half) years, and I believe that this project is the
                        culmination of all that I have learned. Looking back over everything I’ve
                        done over the semester, the poetry and accompanying artwork, I can see that
                        I’ve used this project as a vehicle for my own emotional expression, venting
                        the negativity within me to create a dark and brooding atmosphere on each
                        page. For some time I was quiet… embarrassed by this trajectory I had put
                        myself upon; it felt show-y and over sentimental, but I’m very glad that I
                        allowed myself to express unhindered.</p>

                    <h5>Dec 07, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">While word-counts and N-gram/concordance plots are
                        interesting in their own right, the crown-jewel of text analysis is, in my
                        opinion, networks (NTA). They’re extremely useful in visually representing
                        for an audience the intricate, interwoven nature of a piece of text,
                        demonstrating how two or more aspects of a text (characters, settings,
                        themes, word choice, etc.) are related to one another. They can be
                        stunningly beautiful, while also providing a great resource for better
                        understanding a work! When constructing the network for my poetry, I came
                        across multiple, interesting insights into my body of work that I had not
                        previously even considered, similar to my other escapades into analysis. I
                        had no idea that my poems were so interconnected in the way that they are,
                        that you can draw a path from one poem to another through shared themes so
                        easily. Take, for example, the two poems Virga and Clockface. I wouldn’t
                        expect any relationship between these poems on the surface, but with the
                        network, you can reveal that they share not one but two topics: Fear and
                        Imagery. Something true of both, yet they are so different in their core… </p>

                    <h5>Nov 22, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">Something that my professor and I have been pondering of
                        late is the proverbial “home” and nature of the work within this project; In
                        what format or medium, exactly, does the poetry “live?” Where is it most
                        true to my intentions for it, where is it most honest? I’m not sure I really
                        have an answer, but to begin to delve deeper into the topic, we can start
                        where I do: conception. Every poem in this project began as an idea stashed
                        away in a note on my phone, always available to me whenever inspiration
                        strikes. As I think on it more, I begin building the bones of my poem in my
                        head, sounding out the initial word choices and tempo/rhythm. After this, I
                        sit down to “officially” write my poem in a notebook I keep on my desk, safe
                        at home, each line and stanza carefully handwritten. </p>

                    </a>
                    <h5>Nov 12, 2021</h5>
                    <p class="post_content">My advising professor recommended to me a few works to
                        reflect on as my project nears its end. <a
                            href="http://www.blakearchive.org/work/songsie">William Blake's <i>Songs
                                of Innocence and Experience</i></a>, for some of its similarity to
                        my own work, and <a
                            href="https://newtfire.org/courses/introDH/LEAF-BY-NIGGLE.html">J. R. R.
                            Tolkien's <i>Leaf by Niggle</i></a>, for its commentary on the artistic
                        process. William Blake's <i>Songs of Innocence and Experience</i> is all
                        about duality, that much is obvious. More specifically, I feel as though
                        this collection is contrasting the variance in humanity, life, and virtue.
                        There is a surprising amount of variety in topic across all of the poems,
                        but they're connected with this through line of contrast. I think the pair,
                            <i>Infant Joy</i> (<i>Songs of Innocence</i>) and <i>Infant Sorrow
                            </i>(<i>Songs of Experience</i>) are perfect examples. They're short
                        poems that both tell the story of a child's birth. You have the <i>Joy</i>
                        poem centered around the bliss of creating new life, from the
                        dual-perspectives of child and mother, joined in their happiness. Then
                            <i>Sorrow</i>, where only the child's view is expressed, and the tone of
                        the poem is sullen. The baby unwanted by its parents, by the end it has
                        nothing left to do other than sulk.</p>
