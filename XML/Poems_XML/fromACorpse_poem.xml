        <bgInfo>
            <p>This poem was written in November of 2021 for this project.</p>
            <p>From a Corpse is a companion poem to TO a Corpse. Together, they both tell the story
                of a man who murdered his wife and the twisted, abusive state of their relationship.
                Murder is used an allegory for all domestic violence.</p>
            <p>This poem is from the victim's perspective, showing how she's been manipulated into
                believing that her murder is her own fault. It's an attempt to briefly disect the
                thought-process of a domestic abuse victim.</p>

            <lineInfoPoint passageRef="l3 l4">The narrator puts the blame of her own murder onto
                herself, a very classic response to abuse.</lineInfoPoint>
            <lineInfoPoint passageRef="l5 l6 l7">She's left <q>cold</q> and <q>hollow</q> from his
                abuse, a shell of who she once was.</lineInfoPoint>
            <lineInfoPoint passageRef="l12 l13 l14 l15 l16">Again, she blames herself for what
                happened to her, believing that he was practically forced to hurt her. It's what she
                    <q>deserved</q>.</lineInfoPoint>
            <lineInfoPoint passageRef="l18">She calls him her <q>master</q>, implying that he owns
                her.</lineInfoPoint>
            <lineInfoPoint passageRef="l32">Yearning for <q>atonement</q>, even in death she's
                convinced she's somehow done something wrong and craves his
                forgiveness.</lineInfoPoint>
            <lineInfoPoint passageRef="l36"><q>Tamed</q>... like an animal. That's how she sees
                herself.</lineInfoPoint>
