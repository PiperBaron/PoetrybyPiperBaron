            <p>Lorn was written in November of 2021 for this project.</p>
            <p>This poem is meant to cap off the entire project, a sort of goodbye letter and a
                commentary of my own thoughts on these works.</p>

            <lineInfoPoint passageRef="l1">Being myself, being so shy and anxious.</lineInfoPoint>
            <lineInfoPoint passageRef="l3 l4">Mental illness can be very lonely, even when
                surrounded by people, and it's something I've struggled with for many
                years.</lineInfoPoint>
            <lineInfoPoint passageRef="l10 l11 l12 l13 l14 l15">This is a huge problem for me. I
                love creating — painting, writing, animating — but I'm so stiffled by my fear of
                producing something lacking that often I don't even try.</lineInfoPoint>
            <lineInfoPoint passageRef="l16 l17">I think this is something a lot of people with
                childhood trauma do — grieve their owm child selves.</lineInfoPoint>
            <lineInfoPoint passageRef="l22 l23 l24">This is the line that really encapsulates this
                whole project. I rarely talk about my feelings in real life, even with therapists,
                and so my art, when I push myseslf to produce it, is my way of releasing those
                intense emotions. <q>I cry</q> (inside, privately, through my art), but <q>I don't
                    make a sound</q> (no one really knows that I even feel this
                way).</lineInfoPoint>
