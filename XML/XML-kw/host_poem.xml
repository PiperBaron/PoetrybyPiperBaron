         <p>Host was written for a Creative Writing course in May of 2019, when I was in my
                second year of college</p>
         <p>This poem is, on the surface, about someone discovering something living within them.
                This parasite takes over their body over the course of the work, and by the end, the
                parasite and host are one.</p>
         <p>This is mean to communicate the feeling of mental illness and how it encroaches into
                your personality and identity. I struggle a lot with my mental health, and I have
                felt at times that the darker parts of myself, the illness, consumes me whole.</p>

      <stanza stanzaNum="s2">
         <line lineNum="l2">It has tendrils threaded like muscle that have wrapped around the
                <keyword>beat</keyword>ing of my heart, </line>

         <line lineNum="l4">But, it slowly kills, and through the hollow pupil of my eye,</line>
         <line lineNum="l5">I can see the writhing of some fleshy mass suckling at the wrinkles
                of my brain.</line>
         <line lineNum="l6">It’s as though I lose myself when it pulses;</line>
